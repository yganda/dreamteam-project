    `We like to play as a team, especially when things get tricky. This is why we’re not only holding on to the awesome people already onboard, but also continue to welcome and search for new team members. Just like all of our other activities, the job interviews, onboardings and bootcamps continue as planned, we’ve simply switched to 100% remote work and moved all our interactions online. What’s more, everyone who joins Spartez these days can work from home until the COVID-19 lockdown is over. Subsequently, all new team members from outside the Gdańsk metropolitan area can take up to two months to relocate. 
    It’s business as usual at Spartez. Join us!`,

By introducing your friends and networks to Earthjustice, you'll be supporting our work and providing reassurance to your friends that, above the turmoil of the daily news, Earthjustice's 130 environmental attorneys are working in courts throughout the country — and winning, on the facts and the law — on behalf of hundreds of public-interest clients.",

    fullDescription:
      "The project is about designing an on-line donation management system to enable every person/household to donate anything easily. As many charity organisations are making a big effort to collect donations. It is quite costly and inefficient for charity organisations to do on-door envelope distribution and collection. While many people have unwanted things at their homes, they couldn’t donate due to time limitations. The basic idea is to help people to select preferred charity organisations and send the donation information on line to inform charity organisations. Also to help charity organisations to provide better management of their resources and only make necessary door to door collections. Project deliverable: The project deliverables for this project is a web application showing the donation management system, and a report to describe the stages and process of this project.",
